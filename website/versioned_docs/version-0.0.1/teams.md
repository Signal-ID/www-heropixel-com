# Team Member Roles

Organizations can have as many members as you'd like and as many owners as you'd like. Once you begin adding multiple members to the organization we suggest you enable Two-Factor Authentication across the organization.

## The Owners Role

Owners have equal authority across the organization. Be careful when giving someone ownership capabilities over the organization, as they can then remove you and delete the organization if they choose.

**Important permissions to remember**

- Owners can promote and demote, invite and eject all other owners and members from the organization.
- All owners can see and manage billing.

## The Members Role

Members do not share the same permissions that an owner does.

**Members Can**

- Create and edit pixels
- Download Lead information
- Create Integrations for managing Leads

**Members Cannot**

- Invite other members
- See invoices, or payment methods
- Delete the organization
