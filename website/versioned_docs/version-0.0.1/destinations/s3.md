# S3

This page guides you through the process of setting up the S3 destination connector.

## Prerequisites

List of required fields:

- **S3 Bucket Name**
- **S3 Bucket Path**
- **S3 Bucket Region**

If you are using STS Assume Role, you must provide the following:

- **Role ARN**

Otherwise, if you are using AWS credentials you must provide the following:

- **Access Key ID**
- **Secret Access Key**

If you are using an Instance Profile, you may omit the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key,
as well as, the Role ARN.

Additionally the following prerequisites are required:

1. Allow connections from Hero Pixel server to your AWS S3/ Minio S3 cluster \(if they exist in
   separate VPCs\).
2. An S3 bucket with credentials, a Role ARN, or an instance profile with read/write permissions configured for
   the host (ec2, eks).
3. [Enforce encryption of data in transit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/security-best-practices.html#transit)

## Setup guide

### Step 1: Set up S3

[Sign in](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) to your AWS account.

Prepare S3 bucket that will be used as destination, see
[this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) to create
an S3 bucket.

NOTE: If the S3 cluster is not configured to use TLS, the connection to Amazon S3 silently reverts
to an unencrypted connection. Hero Pixel recommends all connections be configured to use TLS/SSL as
support for AWS's
[shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)

#### Create bucket a Policy

1. Open the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#home).
2. In the IAM dashboard, select **Policies**, then click **Create Policy**.
3. Select the **JSON** tab, then paste the following JSON into the Policy editor (be sure to substitute in your bucket name):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
        "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note
At this time, object-level permissions alone are not sufficient to successfully authenticate the connection. Please ensure you include the **bucket-level** permissions as provided in the example above.
:::

4. Give your policy a descriptive name, then click **Create policy**.

#### Authentication Option 1: Using an IAM Role (Most secure)

<!-- env:cloud -->

:::note
S3 authentication using an IAM role member must be enabled by a member of the Hero Pixel team. If you'd like to use this feature, please [contact the tech team](mailto:support@heropixel.com) for more information.
:::

<!-- /env:cloud -->

1. In the IAM dashboard, click **Roles**, then **Create role**. <!-- env:oss -->
2. Choose the appropriate trust entity and attach the policy you created.
3. Set up a trust relationship for the role. For example for **AWS account** trusted entity use default AWS account on your instance (it will be used to assume role). To use **External ID** set it to environment variables as `export AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_EXTERNAL_ID="{your-external-id}"`. Edit the trust relationship policy to reflect this:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::{your-aws-account-id}:user/{your-username}"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "sts:ExternalId": "{your-external-id}"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

<!-- /env:oss -->
<!-- env:cloud -->

2. Choose the **AWS account** trusted entity type.
3. Set up a trust relationship for the role. This allows the Hero Pixel instance's AWS account to assume this role. You will also need to specify an external ID, which is a secret key that the trusting service (Hero Pixel) and the trusted role (the role you're creating) both know. This ID is used to prevent the "confused deputy" problem. The External ID should be your Hero Pixel workspace ID, which can be found in the URL of your workspace page. Edit the trust relationship policy to include the external ID:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::094410056844:user/delegated_access_user"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "sts:ExternalId": "{your-heropixel-workspace-id}"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

<!-- /env:cloud -->

4. Complete the role creation and note the Role ARN.
5. Select **Attach policies directly**, then find and check the box for your new policy. Click **Next**, then **Add permissions**.

##### Authentication Option 2: Using an IAM User

Use an existing or create new
[Access Key ID and Secret Access Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#:~:text=IAM%20User%20Guide.-,Programmatic%20access,-You%20must%20provide).

1. In the IAM dashboard, click **Users**. Select an existing IAM user or create a new one by clicking **Add users**.
2. If you are using an _existing_ IAM user, click the **Add permissions** dropdown menu and select **Add permissions**. If you are creating a _new_ user, you will be taken to the Permissions screen after selecting a name.
3. Select **Attach policies directly**, then find and check the box for your new policy. Click **Next**, then **Add permissions**.
4. After successfully creating your user, select the **Security credentials** tab and click **Create access key**. You will be prompted to select a use case and add optional tags to your access key. Click **Create access key** to generate the keys.

### Step 2: Set up the S3 destination connector in Hero Pixel

1. Go to local Hero Pixel page.
2. In the left navigation bar, click **Destinations**. In the top-right corner, click **+ new
   destination**.
3. On the destination setup page, select **S3** from the Destination type dropdown and enter a name
   for this connector.
4. Configure fields: _ **Access Key Id** _ See
   [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys)
   on how to generate an access key. _ See
   [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html)
   on how to create a instanceprofile. _ We recommend creating an Hero Pixel-specific user. This user
   will require
   [read and write permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_s3_rw-bucket.html)
   to objects in the staging bucket. \_ If the Access Key and Secret Access Key are not provided, the
   authentication will rely either on the Role ARN using STS Assume Role or on the instanceprofile.
5. _ **Secret Access Key** _ Corresponding key to
   the above key id. _ Make sure your S3 bucket is accessible from the machine running Hero Pixel. _
   This depends on your networking setup. _ You can check AWS S3 documentation with a tutorial on
   how to properly configure your S3's access
   [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-overview.html). _ If
   you use instance profile authentication, make sure the role has permission to read/write on the
   bucket. _ The easiest way to verify if Hero Pixel is able to connect to your S3 bucket is via the
   check connection tool in the UI. _ **S3 Bucket Name** _ See
   [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) to
   create an S3 bucket. _ **S3 Bucket Path** _ Subdirectory under the above bucket to sync the data
   into. _ **S3 Bucket Region** _ See
   [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions)
   for all region codes. _ **S3 Path Format** _ Additional string format on how to store data under
   S3 Bucket Path. Default value is `${NAMESPACE}/${STREAM_NAME}/${YEAR}_${MONTH}_${DAY}_${EPOCH}_`.
   _ **S3 Endpoint** _ Leave empty if using AWS S3, fill in S3 URL if using Minio S3.

   - **S3 Filename pattern** \* The pattern allows you to set the file-name format for the S3
   staging file(s), next placeholders combinations are currently supported: `{date}`,
   `{date:yyyy_MM}`, `{timestamp}`, `{timestamp:millis}`, `{timestamp:micros}`, `{part_number}`,
   `{sync_id}`, `{format_extension}`. Please, don't use empty space and not supportable
   placeholders, as they won't recognized.
   <!-- /env:oss -->

6. Click `Set up destination`.

The full path of the output data with the default S3 Path Format
`${NAMESPACE}/${STREAM_NAME}/${YEAR}_${MONTH}_${DAY}_${EPOCH}_` is:

```text
<bucket-name>/<source-namespace-if-exists>/<stream-name>/<upload-date>_<epoch>_<partition-id>.<format-extension>
```

For example:

```text
testing_bucket/data_output_path/public/users/2021_01_01_1234567890_0.csv.gz
↑              ↑                ↑      ↑     ↑          ↑          ↑ ↑
|              |                |      |     |          |          | format extension
|              |                |      |     |          |          unique incremental part id
|              |                |      |     |          milliseconds since epoch
|              |                |      |     upload date in YYYY_MM_DD
|              |                |      stream name
|              |                source namespace (if it exists)
|              bucket path
bucket name
```

The rationales behind this naming pattern are:

1. Each stream has its own directory.
2. The data output files can be sorted by upload time.
3. The upload time composes of a date part and millis part so that it is both readable and unique.

But it is possible to further customize by using the available variables to format the bucket path:

- `${NAMESPACE}`: Namespace where the stream comes from or configured by the connection namespace
  fields.
- `${STREAM_NAME}`: Name of the stream
- `${YEAR}`: Year in which the sync was writing the output data in.
- `${MONTH}`: Month in which the sync was writing the output data in.
- `${DAY}`: Day in which the sync was writing the output data in.
- `${HOUR}`: Hour in which the sync was writing the output data in.
- `${MINUTE}` : Minute in which the sync was writing the output data in.
- `${SECOND}`: Second in which the sync was writing the output data in.
- `${MILLISECOND}`: Millisecond in which the sync was writing the output data in.
- `${EPOCH}`: Milliseconds since Epoch in which the sync was writing the output data in.
- `${UUID}`: random uuid string

Note:

- Multiple `/` characters in the S3 path are collapsed into a single `/` character.
- If the output bucket contains too many files, the part id variable is using a `UUID` instead. It
  uses sequential ID otherwise.

Please note that the stream name may contain a prefix, if it is configured on the connection. A data
sync may create multiple files as the output files can be partitioned by size (targeting a size of
200MB compressed or lower) .

## Supported sync modes

| Feature                        | Support | Notes                                                                                |
| :----------------------------- | :-----: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full Refresh Sync              |   ✅    | Warning: this mode deletes all previously synced data in the configured bucket path. |
| Incremental - Append Sync      |   ✅    | Warning: Hero Pixel provides at-least-once delivery.                                 |
| Incremental - Append + Deduped |   ❌    |                                                                                      |
| Namespaces                     |   ❌    | Setting a specific bucket path is equivalent to having separate namespaces.          |

The Hero Pixel S3 destination allows you to sync data to AWS S3 or Minio S3. Each stream is written to
its own directory under the bucket.

⚠️ Please note that under "Full Refresh Sync" mode, data in the configured bucket and path will be
wiped out before each sync. We recommend you to provision a dedicated S3 resource for this sync to
prevent unexpected data deletion from misconfiguration. ⚠️

## Supported Output schema

Each stream will be outputted to its dedicated directory according to the configuration. The
complete datastore of each stream includes all the output files under that directory. You can think
of the directory as equivalent of a Table in the database world.

- Under Full Refresh Sync mode, old output files will be purged before new files are created.
- Under Incremental - Append Sync mode, new output files will be added that only contain the new
  data.

### Avro

[Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) serializes data in a compact binary format. Currently, the
Hero Pixel S3 Avro connector always uses the
[binary encoding](http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#binary_encoding), and assumes that
all data records follow the same schema.

#### Configuration

Here is the available compression codecs:

- No compression
- `deflate`
  - Compression level
    - Range `[0, 9]`. Default to 0.
    - Level 0: no compression & fastest.
    - Level 9: best compression & slowest.
- `bzip2`
- `xz`
  - Compression level
    - Range `[0, 9]`. Default to 6.
    - Level 0-3 are fast with medium compression.
    - Level 4-6 are fairly slow with high compression.
    - Level 7-9 are like level 6 but use bigger dictionaries and have higher memory requirements.
      Unless the uncompressed size of the file exceeds 8 MiB, 16 MiB, or 32 MiB, it is waste of
      memory to use the presets 7, 8, or 9, respectively.
- `zstandard`
  - Compression level
    - Range `[-5, 22]`. Default to 3.
    - Negative levels are 'fast' modes akin to `lz4` or `snappy`.
    - Levels above 9 are generally for archival purposes.
    - Levels above 18 use a lot of memory.
  - Include checksum
    - If set to `true`, a checksum will be included in each data block.
- `snappy`

#### Data schema

Under the hood, an Hero Pixel data stream in JSON schema is first converted to an Avro schema, then the
JSON object is converted to an Avro record. Because the data stream can come from any data source,
the JSON to Avro conversion process has arbitrary rules and limitations.

### CSV

Like most of the other Hero Pixel destination connectors, usually the output has three columns: a UUID,
an emission timestamp, and the data blob. With the CSV output, it is possible to normalize
\(flatten\) the data blob to multiple columns.

| Column                | Condition                                                                                         | Description                                                              |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_airbyte_ab_id`      | Always exists                                                                                     | A uuid assigned by Hero Pixel to each processed record.                  |
| `_airbyte_emitted_at` | Always exists.                                                                                    | A timestamp representing when the event was pulled from the data source. |
| `_airbyte_data`       | When no normalization \(flattening\) is needed, all data reside under this column as a json blob. |                                                                          |
| root level fields     | When root level normalization \(flattening\) is selected, the root level fields are expanded.     |                                                                          |

For example, given the following json object from a source:

```json
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "name": {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Doe"
  }
}
```

With no normalization, the output CSV is:

| `_airbyte_ab_id`                       | `_airbyte_emitted_at` | `_airbyte_data`                                                |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `26d73cde-7eb1-4e1e-b7db-a4c03b4cf206` | 1622135805000         | `{ "user_id": 123, name: { "first": "John", "last": "Doe" } }` |

With root level normalization, the output CSV is:

| `_airbyte_ab_id`                       | `_airbyte_emitted_at` | `user_id` | `name`                               |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `26d73cde-7eb1-4e1e-b7db-a4c03b4cf206` | 1622135805000         | 123       | `{ "first": "John", "last": "Doe" }` |

Output files can be compressed. The default option is GZIP compression. If compression is selected,
the output filename will have an extra extension (GZIP: `.csv.gz`).

### JSON Lines \(JSONL\)

[JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) is a text format with one JSON per line. Each line has a
structure as follows:

```json
{
  "_airbyte_ab_id": "<uuid>",
  "_airbyte_emitted_at": "<timestamp-in-millis>",
  "_airbyte_data": "<json-data-from-source>"
}
```

For example, given the following two json objects from a source:

```json
[
  {
    "user_id": 123,
    "name": {
      "first": "John",
      "last": "Doe"
    }
  },
  {
    "user_id": 456,
    "name": {
      "first": "Jane",
      "last": "Roe"
    }
  }
]
```

They will be like this in the output file:

```text
{ "_airbyte_ab_id": "26d73cde-7eb1-4e1e-b7db-a4c03b4cf206", "_airbyte_emitted_at": "1622135805000", "_airbyte_data": { "user_id": 123, "name": { "first": "John", "last": "Doe" } } }
{ "_airbyte_ab_id": "0a61de1b-9cdd-4455-a739-93572c9a5f20", "_airbyte_emitted_at": "1631948170000", "_airbyte_data": { "user_id": 456, "name": { "first": "Jane", "last": "Roe" } } }
```

Output files can be compressed. The default option is GZIP compression. If compression is selected,
the output filename will have an extra extension (GZIP: `.jsonl.gz`).

### Parquet

#### Configuration

The following configuration is available to configure the Parquet output:

| Parameter                 |  Type   |    Default     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :------------------------ | :-----: | :------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compression_codec`       |  enum   | `UNCOMPRESSED` | **Compression algorithm**. Available candidates are: `UNCOMPRESSED`, `SNAPPY`, `GZIP`, `LZO`, `BROTLI`, `LZ4`, and `ZSTD`.                                                                                                        |
| `block_size_mb`           | integer |   128 \(MB\)   | **Block size \(row group size\)** in MB. This is the size of a row group being buffered in memory. It limits the memory usage when writing. Larger values will improve the IO when reading, but consume more memory when writing. |
| `max_padding_size_mb`     | integer |    8 \(MB\)    | **Max padding size** in MB. This is the maximum size allowed as padding to align row groups. This is also the minimum size of a row group.                                                                                        |
| `page_size_kb`            | integer |  1024 \(KB\)   | **Page size** in KB. The page size is for compression. A block is composed of pages. A page is the smallest unit that must be read fully to access a single record. If this value is too small, the compression will deteriorate. |
| `dictionary_page_size_kb` | integer |  1024 \(KB\)   | **Dictionary Page Size** in KB. There is one dictionary page per column per row group when dictionary encoding is used. The dictionary page size works like the page size but for dictionary.                                     |
| `dictionary_encoding`     | boolean |     `true`     | **Dictionary encoding**. This parameter controls whether dictionary encoding is turned on.                                                                                                                                        |

These parameters are related to the `ParquetOutputFormat`. See the
[Java doc](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.parquet/parquet-hadoop/1.12.0/org/apache/parquet/hadoop/ParquetOutputFormat.html)
for more details. Also see
[Parquet documentation](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/configurations/) for their
recommended configurations \(512 - 1024 MB block size, 8 KB page size\).

#### Data schema

Under the hood, an Hero Pixel data stream in JSON schema is first converted to an Avro schema, then the
JSON object is converted to an Avro record, and finally the Avro record is outputted to the Parquet
format. Because the data stream can come from any data source, the JSON to Avro conversion process
has arbitrary rules and limitations.

In order for everything to work correctly, it is also necessary that the user whose "S3 Key Id" and
"S3 Access Key" are used have access to both the bucket and its contents. Policies to use:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
