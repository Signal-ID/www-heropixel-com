            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Signal ID Inc. (“We” “Our” “Signal ID”) provides data marketing
              services (the “Services”) that assist for-profit and not-profit
              organizations (and other companies that service them) to market
              their goods and services in a relevant and efficient way. Our
              solutions, which are described on this website, are used
              principally to support email marketing, particularly targeted
              email marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We take seriously the personal privacy interests of the
              individuals whose information we handle and maintain in our
              database. We provide this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to
              explain how we use and manage information, and what rights
              consumers have to control how their information is used in
              marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
              To review the “Addendum” we have created specifically to address
              disclosures required under the{' '}
              <strong>California Consumer Privacy Act</strong>, which also sets
              forth, please see our “

            <p>
              We also operate corporate websites designed for our own customers
              and prospective customers, and others who want to learn about our
              services. We address the information we collect and use for those
              business purposes (such as information we use to communicate with
              our corporate customers, and potential customers) in Section 6 of
              this Privacy Policy.

            <h2>1. Information That We Collect and Use in Our Services</h2>
            <p>
              In order to provide our Services, we make available, collect, or
              receive data, including personal information, to and from a
              variety of sources, including from websites and apps that collect
              the information as well as other data compilers. We refer to the
              information that we collect and process throughout this Privacy
              Policy as “Information” or “the Information.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The Information that we may collect, receive (including from third
              parties), store, or make available includes various identifying
              information such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Name and home address (address may be mapped via street or
                geo-location coordinates)
              </li>
              <li>
                Personal or professional email addresses (which may be
                maintained as “hashed” values)
              </li>
              <li>
                Other contact information such as email address and phone number
              </li>
              <li>
                IP address (which we likewise may map to estimated geo-location
                coordinates)
              </li>
              <li>
                A cookie or device identifier which uniquely identifies your
                browser or device along with other browser attributes such as
                user agents, time stamps, and page views
              </li>
              <li>
                Usage data related to your email interactions such as whether
                you receive, open, or respond to an email and related
                information
              </li>
              <li>
                Usage data related to your website interactions such as whether
                you visit or log in to a website, page visits, purchases, data
                input or captured on a website, and related information and what
                content you view or interact with
              </li>
              <li>
                Information and actions associated with an email such as whether
                an email has recently been in use and the amount and type of
                marketing or “email open” activity associated with an email
              </li>
              <li>
                Demographic information such as inferred income or age/age range
                household size or home ownership or number of persons in a
                household
              </li>
              <li>
                Information regarding consumer interests such as what type of
                products you may be interested in or what types of hobbies you
                might have such as whether you are a likely pet owner or a
                sports or art enthusiast
              </li>
              <li>
                Other household information such as mortgage information,
                mortgage rate, amount owed, lender, and related information,
                assets owned, and other information from publicly available
                files
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Some of the above Information may be inferred – for instance, if a
              household is in a particularly wealthy area we might infer a
              particular income range. We also sometimes associate personal
              information with aggregated information such as aggregated
              information about tax assessments, credit ranges or other
              household data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we may create a unique browser or device identifier
              (sometimes called a unique “fingerprint”), by combining various
              machine, browser and/or network attributes. These may include, for
              instance, information related to a user's operating system,
              browser type, screen resolution and size, user agent, time zone,
              keyboard layout, central processing unit (CPU), data processing
              unit (DPU), and other attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may combine any of the points of Information we collect or
              receive with other Information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Signal ID also receives Information through this website (and any
              other website we operate), and our business operations. We
              describe this Information in Section 6.

            <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
            <p>
              Signal ID uses the Information for various purposes, including the
              following:
            </p>
            <h3>As Part of Our Services:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Data Marketing Services:</strong> Our Services include
                providing marketing information to our customers generally
                regarding which customers or prospective customers are most
                likely to be interested (or disinterested) in certain offers or
                have engaged with a particular website or brand. We also may
                help our customers identify and understand their customers
                better by providing insights about them. Our customers may
                include (but are not limited to) small and medium-sized
                businesses, non-profit entities, ad and media agencies, brands,
                and marketing data platforms that help their customers to market
                and advertise to their own customers (and prospective
                customers).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Retargeting Services:</strong> We often help our
                customers to “retarget” marketing content to website visitors.
                In particular, our Services help customers interested in
                delivering emails to people who have visited or logged in to
                their websites (or mobile apps). These Services may involve
                sending advertising content to these visitors across other
                websites, apps, devices or marketing channels, including through
                digital, email, mobile or television or direct mail channels.
                These services often involve combining certain types of personal
                information, such cookie identifiers and IP addresses – which
                identify your browser or device and/or network – with other
                personal information that has been collected by third parties.
                Using these Services, our customers may send you an email based
                on your prior visit to their website – for instance, reminding
                you that unpurchased goods are in your “cart,” offering you
                additional discounts or making additional purchase suggestions.
                As described in Section 4 above, you may opt out of this type of
                advertising.
              </li>
              <li>
                When we do this, we may use techniques such as “hashing” for
                privacy purposes, so that an email address is not reflected in
                our files in a “clear text” manner.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Additional Marketing Services:</strong> Other Services
                we may provide to our customers (or help them to provide to
                their own customers), which may supplement the above Services,
                may involve (a) assisting customers to target and optimize email
                campaigns, display, or other marketing; (b) measuring how
                effective marketing campaigns have been, by determining which
                messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of
                consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to
                purchases; (c) analyzing and optimizing our customers’ (or their
                service providers’) proprietary databases; (d) helping customers
                to detect and prevent fraud and provide “validation” or data
                hygiene services, e.g., by verifying or removing or correcting
                old, incorrect or outdated information or evaluating whether an
                email address recently has been active.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>To Operate Our Services</h3>
            <p>
              We also use the Information described above for our own internal
              purposes – such as to improve, test, update and verify our own
              database; develop new products; operate, analyze, improve and
              secure our Services and our databases and servers.

            <p>
              Signal ID may share the Information with customers, marketing
              services and platforms, as well as service providers that help us
              to provide the Services we’ve described above (or other services
              we may add in the future). This includes sharing in the following
              ways
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>With Our Customers:</strong> As described above, we
                license the Information in various ways to our customers (and
                something to partners and resellers, who license the Information
                to their customer), when we provide our Services. We may
                sometimes share the Information with those customers’ service
                providers (for instance, a provider that prints or sends
                mailings for a customer).
              </li>

                provide more tailored targeted marketing, advertising and
                communications. Likewise, we may do so for analytical purposes,
                including to help these other parties measure campaign
                performance, inform future campaigns, or to handle, analyze, or
                segregate this Information on our or our customers’ behalf.

              <li>
                <strong>With Our Service Providers:</strong> We share the

                operate, protect and advertise our Services and maintain our
                website(s). For instance, we may share the Information with our
                tech, hosting and customer support providers, marketing and
                advertising providers, other data providers (such as to enhance

              There are multiple ways that you can opt-out of having the
              Information used to market to you:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                First, you may visit our opt-out page at{' '}
                <a href="https://app.heropixel.com/optout">
                  https://app.heropixel.com/optout
                </a>{' '}
                to have your personal information removed from our database (in
                which case we will generally retain such information for
                suppression purposes, going forward). We will then in most cases
                remove your personal information from our active marketing
                databases within 15 business days, from the time we received the
                opt-out request. We may in certain cases (where legally
                permissible) require that you verify any of the information that
                you submit, such as through a verified email response or another
                verified response.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you would like to opt-out of email marketing from a
                particular brand (such as a customer of ours), click on the “opt
                out” or “unsubscribe” link in the footer (at the bottom) of the
                marketing email you have received. Please also note that these
                emails do not generally come from us – you will need to contact
                the brand through their unsubscribe methods, whether within
                their emails or on their websites.
              </li>
              <li>
                While we generally do not engage in “direct mail” marketing,
                some of our customers and partners may. If you are interested in
                opting out of this type of marketing – i.e., materials received
                in your physical mailbox -- we recommend that you visit the DMA
                Choice website, at
                <a href="http://dmachoice.thedma.org"> DMA Choice</a> The
                DMAChoice service is run by the Direct Marketing Association and
                allows you to follow a few easy steps to ensure that your
                marketing preferences are honored.
              </li>
              <li>
                To opt out of our Retargeting Services described in section 2,
                go to{' '}
                <a href="https://app.heropixel.com/optout">
                  {' '}
                  https://app.heropixel.com/optout
                </a>{' '}
                and click on the “Manage Cookie Preferences” bar on that page.
                You will need to do that from each browser that you use (because
                the retargeting and thus the “opt out” are cookie-based), and if
                you clear your browser cookies you will need to opt out again.
                Alternatively, you may provide us with your email address, on
                that same page, to opt out that particular email from our
                email-based Retargeting Services. You may also “opt out” of
                cross-contextual behavioral advertising by using a browser or
                browser extension that sends a “Global Privacy Control” or “GPC”
                signal. We honor this signal when it is detectable by us. You
                can learn about this signal by visiting the website

                .
              </li>
              <li>
                If we market to you by email, in our corporate capacity – such
                as if you are a customer or prospective customer of ours and we
                send you information about our Services -- you may “unsubscribe”
                from our marketing emails through a link placed in your emails.

            <h2>5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
            <h3>Cookies and How We Use Them</h3>
            <p>
              Signal ID and its business partners use certain industry-standard
              technologies, including cookies and similarly functioning
              technologies, which we describe below. (We and/or our service
              providers use these technologies on our website, for instance, and
              our partners may use these technologies in their own marketing
              services.)
            </p>
            <p>
              We may work with third parties or service providers to provide or
              enhance our services (e.g. for purposes of tailoring ads, or
              placing browser cookies), or to offer marketers ways to access or
              use the personal Information that we make available. These
              business partners of ours may set and access their own cookies,
              pixel tags and similar technologies on your browser, which may
              have cookies with varying expiration periods. Those partners may,
              likewise, collect various types of information about your browser,
              device, or browsing activities through use of these cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies, in turn, are small data files that contain a string of
              characters, such as a unique browser identifier. Cookies are
              stored on your computer or other device and act as tags that
              identify your device. Our (or other companies’) servers send your
              device a cookie when you visit a website. A pixel tag (also
              commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1
              pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access web
              pages (such as the website of a marketer we work with), pixel tags
              may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit our partners
              (or sometimes, us) to read the cookies that a respective company
              or server has deployed. Pixel tags are used in combination with
              cookies to track the activity on a site by a particular device.
              When you turn off cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given
              website visit.
            </p>
            <p>
              We or our service providers, and other online marketing platforms
              that we or they work with, may use cookies to, among other things,
              “remember” you, determine visitor patterns and trends, collect
              information about your activities on our clients’ sites, or
              interact with the advertising you see. Cookies can be used in this
              way to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant
              communications with ads that better match your interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may sometimes use technologies that are functionally similar to
              cookies, that use other information (described in Section 1) to
              create a unique identifier or “fingerprint” from or of a browser
              or machine, as a means of uniquely identifying or resolving the
              identity of a user.
            </p>
            <h3>Retargeting and Cross-Channel Advertising</h3>
            <p>
              We use cookies and similar technologies (as described above) in
              our Retargeting Services, which involves combining cookie
              identifiers and IP addresses – which identify your browser or
              device and/or network – with other personal information, often
              that has been collected by third parties. (We may rely on third
              party data providers to perform this combination.) Based on these
              data combinations, sometimes called an “identity graph,” when you
              visit or log into a website (such as a brand that you wish to
              purchase goods from) you may later receive an email – for
              instance, reminding you that un-purchased goods are in your
              “cart,” offering you additional discounts or making additional
              purchase suggestions. As described in Section 4 above, you may opt
              out of this type of advertising.
            </p>
            <h3>Disabling Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies, or at least to
              accept certain types of cookies. You may be able to set your
              browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse
              certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in
              your web browser, some features of our website and other services
              may be difficult to use or become inoperable.

              NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS [CONSUMERS] – CALIFORNIA CONSUMER
              PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT
            </h3>
            <p>
              The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the
              California Privacy Rights Act (together the “CCPA”) provides
              certain rights to residents of California. A number of other
              states provide the same or similar rights to their residents – as
              their own respective privacy laws become effective. (These states
              include but are not limited to Virginia, Colorado, Utah, Montana,
              Connecticut, Indiana, Texas and others.) This section of the
              Privacy Policy applies if you are a natural person who is a
              resident of California or another applicable state (collectively,
              “Applicable States”), and whose personal information we hold as a
              “controller” or “business” – in other words, when we decide how
              that information is used, shared and stored.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Addendum supplements the information in the Privacy Policy.
              However, this Addendum is intended solely for, and is applicable
              only as to residents of Applicable States.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the below tables and sections, we describe (as required by the
              CCPA and/or other laws):
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Our Collection of Personal Information – the types of Personal
                Information (which the CCPA defines broadly) that we collect,
                the types of sources we collect it from,
              </li>
              <li>
                Our Disclosure and Sale (and Sharing) of Personal Information –
                the types of recipients to whom we disclose or sell Personal
                Information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our Business Purposes – our business purposes for (a) collecting
                and (b) sharing Personal Information, which are generally the
                same.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your California and other relevant Privacy Rights and Choices –
                what rights you have under the CCPA and similar laws of other
                states, for instance, to request that we “opt out” your
                information from our marketing database (also called “do not
                sell” rights) and/or cease using your information for targeted
                advertising, or to request categories and personal information
                that we may have collected about you.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The following sets forth the categories of information we collect
              and purposes for which we may use the personal information of
              residents of Applicable States (which includes California):

            <p>
              Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights,
              residents of Applicable States (which includes California) have
              the right to request that we disclose what personal information we
              collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of
              the sale of your personal information, subject to certain
              restrictions. You also have the right to designate an agent to
              exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how
              to exercise those rights and our process for handling those
              requests. (To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may
              charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes, we act only as a “service provider” to our clients (for
              instance, if they provide information to us for analytics,
              processing or other data management services), in which case any
              consumer requests for opt-out, deletion or access to data must be
              made through that client: we therefore will forward any such
              requests to a named client, as feasible, such as where a client
              has been identified.

              or call our Privacy Center +1 (855) 474-7028. When you make such a

              “suppression” list, so that we may remove your data from our
              active database in the event we obtain it again at a later

            <p>
              Opting out from sale in the above way will also opt out of our
              “sharing” of your personal information. “Sharing” is a term used
              in California privacy law that means use of personal information

              California privacy rights. For instance, if you request specific
              pieces of personal information we have received about you, you may
              need to confirm your possession of an identifier (such as an email
              address) that reasonably confirms you are the person you claim to
              be.

              We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a
              different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to
              exercise these rights.

              If you disagree with a decision we have made in response to your
              request that we exercise any of the rights we have described, you
              may (depending what state you are a resident of) have a right to
              “appeal” our decision. You may do so by writing to us at
              <a href="mailto:support@heropixel.com"> support@heropixel.com</a>.

              F. Information about persons under the age of 16
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under
              16 years of age in California or other Applicable States unless we
              have received legal consent to do so (where such consent is
              required). If we learn that personal information from such
              consumers has been collected, we will take reasonable steps to
              remove their information from our database (or to obtain legally
              required consent).

            <p class="text-bold">G. Authorized agents</p>
            <p>
              You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your
              rights under CCPA as described above. We will take steps both to
              verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights
              as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized
              to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a
              signed written authorization or a copy of a legally sufficient
              power of attorney. We likewise may require that you verify your
              own identity, depending on the type of request you make.
