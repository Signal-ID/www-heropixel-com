                There are multiple ways that you can opt-out of having the

              </p>
              <ul>

                  You may visit our opt-out page at [________________] to have
                  your personal information removed from our database. We will
                  then in most cases remove your personal information from our
                  active marketing databases within 15 business days from the
                  time we received the opt-out request. We may in certain cases
                  (where legally permissible) require that you verify any of the
                  information that you submit such as through a verified email

                  “opt out” or “unsubscribe” link in the footer (at the bottom)
                  of the marketing email you have received. Please also note
                  that these emails do not generally come from us – you will
                  need to contact the brand through their unsubscribe methods
                  whether within their emails or on their websites.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While we generally do not engage in “direct mail” marketing
                  some of our customers and partners may. If you are interested
                  in opting out of this type of marketing – i.e. materials
                  received in your physical mailbox -- we recommend that you
                  visit the DMA Choice website at dmachoice.thedma.org. The DMA
                  Choice service is run by the Direct Marketing Association and
                  allows you to follow a few easy steps to ensure that your
                  marketing preferences are honored.

                  To opt out of our Retargeting Services described in section 2
                  go to [_______________________] and click on the “Cookie Based
                  Opt Out” bar on that page. You will need to do that from each
                  browser that you use (because the retargeting and thus the
                  “opt out” are cookie-based) and if you clear your browser

              <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
              <h3>Cookies and How We Use Them</h3>
              <p>
                Signal ID and its business partners use certain
                industry-standard technologies including cookies and similarly
                functioning technologies which we describe below. (We and/or our
                service providers use these technologies on our website for
                instance and our partners may use these technologies in their
                own marketing services.)
              </p>
              <p>
                We may work with third parties or service providers to provide
                or enhance our services (e.g. for purposes of tailoring ads or
                placing browser cookies) or to offer marketers ways to access or
                use the personal Information that we make available. These
                business partners of ours may set and access their own cookies
                pixel tags and similar technologies on your browser which may
                have cookies with varying expiration periods. Those partners may
                likewise collect various types of information about your browser
                device or browsing activities through use of these cookies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies in turn are small data files that contain a string of
                characters such as a unique browser identifier. Cookies are
                stored on your computer or other device and act as tags that
                identify your device. Our (or other companies’) servers send
                your device a cookie when you visit a website. A pixel tag (also
                commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x
                1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access web
                pages (such as the website of a marketer we work with) pixel
                tags may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit our
                partners (or sometimes us) to read the cookies that a respective
                company or server has deployed. Pixel tags are used in
                combination with cookies to track the activity on a site by a
                particular device. When you turn off cookies pixel tags simply
                detect a given website visit.
              </p>
              <p>
                We or our service providers and other online marketing platforms
                that we or they work with may use cookies to among other things

                information about your activities on our clients’ sites or
                interact with the advertising you see. Cookies can be used in
                this way to provide relevant content to you and replace
                non-relevant communications with ads that better match your
                interests.
              </p>
              <h3>Retargeting and Cross-Channel Advertising</h3>
              <p>
                We use cookies in our Retargeting Services which involves
                combining cookie identifiers and IP addresses – which identify
                your browser or device and/or network – with other personal
                information often that has been collected by third parties. (We
                may rely on third party data providers to perform this
                combination.) Based on these data combinations sometimes called
                an “identity graph” when you visit or log into a website (such
                as a brand that you wish to purchase goods from) you may later
                receive an email – for instance reminding you that unpurchased
                goods are in your “cart” offering you additional discounts or
                making additional purchase suggestions. As described in Section
                4 above you may opt out of this type of advertising.
              </p>
              <h3>Disabling Cookies</h3>
              <p>
                Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies or at least to
                accept certain types of cookies. You may be able to set your
                browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to
                refuse certain cookies. However if you disable the use of
                cookies in your web browser some features of our website and
                other services may be difficult to use or become inoperable.

              <p>
                The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the
                California Privacy Rights Act (together the “CCPA”) provides
                certain rights to residents of California. A number of other
                states provide the same or similar rights to their residents –
                as their own respective privacy laws become effective. (These
                states include but are not limited to Virginia Colorado Utah
                Montana Connecticut Indiana Texas and others.) This section of
                the Privacy Policy applies if you are a natural person who is a
                resident of California or another applicable state (collectively
                “Applicable States”) and whose personal information we hold as a

                STATE LAWS
              </h3>
              <p>
                Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights
                residents of Applicable States (which includes California) have
                the right to request that we disclose what personal information
                we collect from you to delete that information and to opt-out of
                the sale of your personal information subject to certain
                restrictions. You also have the right to designate an agent to
                exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how
                to exercise those rights and our process for handling those
                requests. (To the extent permitted by applicable law we may
                charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes we act only as a “service provider” to our clients
                (for instance if they provide information to us for analytics
                processing or other data management services) in which case any
                consumer requests for opt-out deletion or access to data must be
                made through that client: we therefore will forward any such
                requests to a named client as feasible such as where a client
                has been identified.
              </p>

                A. Right to request that we “do not sell” or “do not share” your
                personal information
              </p>
              <p>
                You may request that we not “sell” your personal information. If
                you wish to make such a “do not sell” (also called an “opt out”
                request) please go to our “Do Not Sell” web form located at
                [___________]. Alternatively you may contact us by email at
                ________. When you make such a request we will retain your
                information on an internal “suppression” list so that we may
                remove your data from our active database in the event we obtain
                it again at a later
              </p>
              <p>
                Opting our from sale in the above way will also opt out out of
                our “sharing” of your personal information. “Sharing” is a term
                used in California privacy law that means use of personal
                information for cross-context behavioral advertising also known
                as targeted advertising.

              </p>
              <p>
                You may request that we delete or correct any personal
                information that we collected from such as if you have been a
                customer of ours. Note that this is different from your right to
                “opt out” of us selling your personal information which is
                described above; also note that we do not generally collect
                personal information directly from consumers.) You may make a
                deletion or correction request by visiting our Privacy Portal at
                [____________] or by calling our toll-free number at
                [_____________]. In our discretion we may interpret your
                “deletion” request as a “Do Not Sell” request (and thus place it
                on a suppression list as described above) if we in good faith
                believe that is what you are requesting.
              </p>
              <p>
                After honoring a deletion request we may still retain personal
                information for certain important purposes such as (a) to
                protect our business systems and users from fraudulent activity
                (b) to address technical issues that impair existing
                functionality (such as de-bugging purposes) (c) as necessary for
                us or others to exercise their free speech or other rights (d)
                to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful
                process (e) for scientific or historical research (f) for our
                own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship
                with us or to comply with legal obligations. Additionally we
                need certain types of information so that we can provide our
                Services to you. If you ask us to delete it you may no longer be
                able to access or use our Services.

              </p>
              <p>
                Residents of Applicable States also have the right to request
                that we disclose what categories of your personal information
                that we collect use or sell. As a resident of such a state you
                may also request the specific pieces of personal information
                that we have collected from you. You may make such an “access”
                or “right to know” request by visiting our Privacy Portal at
                [__________] us [__________] or by calling our toll-free number
                at [_____________]. We may withhold some personal information
                where the risk to you or to others’ privacy rights is too great
                to disclose the information.

              <p>
                For security purposes (and as required under California law) we
                will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain
                information from you — when you request to exercise your
                California privacy rights. For instance if you request specific
                pieces of personal information we have received about you you
                may need to confirm your possession of an identifier (such as an
                email address) that reasonably confirms you are the person you
                claim to be.

                may (depending what state you are a resident of) have a right to

                We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors
                under 16 years of age in California or other Applicable States
                unless we have received legal consent to do so (where such

                such consumers has been collected we will take reasonable steps

                legally required consent).

                your rights under CCPA as described above. We will take steps
                both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise
                their rights as listed above and to verify that your agent has
                been authorized to make a request on your behalf through
                providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a
                legally sufficient power of attorney. We likewise may require
                that you verify your own identity depending on the type of
                request you make.
